Hey! I'm Richard, a third-year undergrad at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) studying Computer Science and minoring in Control & Dynamical Systems (CDS). I'm advised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/people/adamw).

I'm particularly interested in applications to self-driving vehicles and intelligent robotics, specifically through spatial reasoning, large language models, model predictive control, and perception/vision. Right now, I'm researching scalable multi-agent RL! I'm also working on LLM post-training to prove polynomial inequalities under [Prof. Tony Yue Yu](https://tyy.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://pma.caltech.edu/). I've previously worked under [Dr. Alec Reed](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/alec-reed) at CU Boulder's [Autonomous Robotics Lab](https://arpg.github.io/) on predictive vehicle dynamics.

I have previously interned at [Commerzbank](https://www.commerzbank.de/group/) in New York City and [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) in Seattle, working on software development.
