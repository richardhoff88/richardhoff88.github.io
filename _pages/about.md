Hey! I'm Richard, a third-year undergrad at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) studying Computer Science and minoring in Control & Dynamical Systems. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/people/adamw).


Humans learn quickly, reason abstractly, adapt to new environments, and coordinate with others. Broadly, my goal is to design embodied AI systems that can do the same. My research sits at the intersection of reinforcement learning, control-theory, generative modeling, and spatial intelligence. Right now, I'm excited about [**multi-agent RL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_reinforcement_learning), specifically how intelligence scales across interacting populations. I'm also interested in generalizing robot learning and planning via [**video modeling**](https://www.boyuan.space/large-video-planner/), where I'm working on efficient, temporally consistent generative paradigms. 


I previously worked on LLM post-training with [Prof. Tony Yue Yu](https://tyy.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://pma.caltech.edu/), and under [Dr. Alec Reed](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/alec-reed) at CU Boulder's [Autonomous Robotics Lab](https://arpg.github.io/) on predictive vehicle dynamics. I interned at [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) in Seattle and [Commerzbank](https://www.commerzbank.de/group/) in New York City.
