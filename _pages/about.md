Hey! I'm Richard, a third-year undergrad at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) studying Computer Science and minoring in Control & Dynamical Systems. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/people/adamw).

Broadly, I'm interested in embodied AI. My work involves reinforcement learning, decision-making, large language models, and spatial intelligence.  Right now, I'm researching scalable [**multi-agent RL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_reinforcement_learning)! I'm also working on LLM post-training to prove polynomial inequalities under [Prof. Tony Yue Yu](https://tyy.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://pma.caltech.edu/). In the past, I worked under [Dr. Alec Reed](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/alec-reed) at CU Boulder's [Autonomous Robotics Lab](https://arpg.github.io/) on predictive vehicle dynamics.

I have interned at [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) in Seattle and [Commerzbank](https://www.commerzbank.de/group/) in New York City working on software development.
